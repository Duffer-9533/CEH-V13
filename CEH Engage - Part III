::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Challenge 1:

An attacker tried to perform session hijacking on a machine from 172.30.10.0/24 subnet. An incident handler found a packet capture file $_Jack.pcapng obtained from the victim machine which is stored in Documents folder of EH Workstation  -1. You are assigned to analyse the packet capture file and determine the IP of the victim machine targeted by the attacker. (Format: NNN.NN.NN.NNN)

Ans = 172.30.10.200

Challenge 2:

An attacker tried to intercept a login session by intercepting the http traffic from the victim machine. The security analyst captured the traffic and stored it in Downloads folder of EH Workstation -1 as Intercep_$niffer.pcapng. Analyse the pcap file and determine the credentials captured by the attacker.  (Format: aaa/aaaa)

Ans = lee/test

Challenge 3:

A honeypot has been set up on a machine within the 192.168.10.0/24 subnet to monitor and detect malicious network activity. Your task is to analyze the honeypot log file, cowrie.log, located in the Downloads folder of EH Workstation -2, and determine the attacker IP trying to access the target machine. (Format: NNN*NN*NN*NN)

Ans = 172.30.10.99

Challenge 5:

You’re a cybersecurity investigator assigned to a high-priority case. Martin is suspected of engaging in illegal crypto activities, and it’s believed that he has stored his crypto account password in a file named $ollers.txt. Your mission is to crack the SSH credentials for Martin’s machine within the 192.168.10.0/24 subnet and retrieve the password from the $ollers.txt file. (Hint: Search in the folders present on the Desktop to find the target file) (Format: aNaa**NNNNNAA*)

Challenge 6:

Attackers have identified a vulnerable website and stored the details of this website on one of the machines within the 192.168.10.0/24 subnet. As a cybersecurity investigator you have been tasked to crack the FTP credentials of user nick and determine the ID of the domain. The information you need has been gathered and stored in the w_domain.txt file.  (Format: NNNNNNNNNN)
