::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Challenge 7:  
You are assigned to analyse the domain controller from the target subnet and perform AS-REP roasting attack on the user accounts and determine the password of the vulnerable user whose credentials are obtained. Note: use users.txt and rockyou.txt files stored in attacker home directory while cracking the credentials. (Format: aNaaN*NNN)

Ans = c3ll0@123

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Challenge 8:  
A client machine under the target domain controller has a misconfigured SQL server vulnerability. Your task is to exploit this vulnerability, retrieve the MSS.txt file located in the Public Downloads folder on the client machine and determine its size in bytes as answer. Note: use users.txt and rockyou.txt files stored in attacker home directory while cracking the credentials. (Format: N)

Ans = 7

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Challenge 9:  
You are assigned to crack RDP credentials of user Maurice from the target subnet 192.168.10.0/24 and determine the password as answer. Note: use Note: use users.txt and rockyou.txt files stored in attacker home directory while cracking the credentials. (Format: Aaaaaaa@NNNN)

Ans = Pumpkin@1234

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Challenge 10:  
You are assigned to perform malware scanning on a malware file Tools.rar stored in Downloads folder of EH workstation-2 machine and determine the last four digits of the fileâ€™s SHA-256 hash value. (Format: aNNN)

Ans = d282

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Challenge 11:  
You are assigned to monitor a suspicious process running in a machine whose log file Logfile.PML is saved in Pictures folder of the EH Workstation -2. Analyse the logfile and determine the Parent PID of the malicious file H3ll0.exe process from the log file. (Format: NNNN)

Ans = 6952

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Challenge 12:  
You are tasked with analyzing the ELF executable file named Tornado.elf, located in the Downloads folder of EH Workstation-2. Determine the entropy value of the file up to two decimal places. (Format: N*NN)

Ans = 2.87903

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Challenge 13:  
You are assigned to scan the target subnets to identify the remote packet capture feature that is enabled to analyse the traffic on the target machine remotetly. Scan the target subnets and determine the IP address using rpcap service.  (Format: NNN.NNN.NN.NNN)

Ans = 192.168.10.144
