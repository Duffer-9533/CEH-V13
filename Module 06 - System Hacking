Question 6.5.7.1
Use Parrot Security machine to identify the Domain Controller in the target network 10.10.1.0/24 and perform AS-REP roasting on Windows Server 2022 (10.10.1.22) to obtain of user Joshua. Perform password spraying on the subnet to identify the user with same password on the subnet. Connect to the user account that was compromised during password spraying and use PowerView to perform enumeration and exploit SQL_srv user enumerated with PowerView to obtain privileged access to the domain and perform kerberoasting on target Domain Controller (Windows Server 2022) to obtain password of DC-Admin. Enter the password of the DC-Admin user that was obtained after kerberoasting. 

Ans = advanced!
