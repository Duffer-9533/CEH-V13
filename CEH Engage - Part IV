Challenge 14:
You have received a folder named "Archive" from a vendor. You suspect that someone might have tampered with the files during transmission. The Original hashes of the files have been sent by the sender separately and are stored in a file named FileHashes.txt stored in the Document folder in the "EH Workstation – 2" machine. Your task is to check the integrity of the files by comparing the MD5 hashes. Compare the hash values and determine the file name that has been tampered with.
